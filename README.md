# OAuthTutorial
I don't understand how they put multiple projects in one spot that all depended upon the SocialApplication main method.
My pom.xml that isn't nested isn't correct. I tried to use 	<packaging>pom</packaging> how they did in their pom file
but it kept updating the project to not include maven dependencies. 
On the other hand the tutorial made sense for the most part. Next time I should probably learn how to nest projects.
